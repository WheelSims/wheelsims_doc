# WheelSims

The WheelSims project is an initiative led by Pr. Félix Chénier and funded by the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies (FRQNT) via two Team Grants (2020-2023, 2024-2027) and via the [FRQNT-INTER](https://regroupementinter.com) strategic group.

This project aims to develop virtual-reality environments and technologies for wheelchair propulsion using a user-centric and open-source approach. The objective is to facilitate technology transfers between research laboratories and from research to clinics.
