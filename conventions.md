We try to follow [Godot's guidelines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).

In addition to these conventions, we use the following approach to naming things:

```
snake_case_everywhere
```

Snake case means `lower_case_with_words_separated_with_underscores`.

Any variable name, object name (be it in Blender or Godot), file name, __practically anything__ uses this convention. This is in an effort to keep the code structured, easier to maintain, and to avoid versioning and distribution problems.
